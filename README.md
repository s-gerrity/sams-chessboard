## Sam's Chessboard
Inspired by interview project from Issio

### Overview

I was assigned this project for a Software Engineering position and was unable to complete it. I've since been chipping away at it and expanding its scope. 

This board uses JavaScript object-orientation to assemble 5 pieces (hardcoded). Via tests, moves are input and confirmed or rejected for Bishop or Rook only. 

### Roadmap

– More pieces: Plans to expand with more pieces.
– Visuals: Can create a web based chessboard that displays moves. 
– Pieces strategy: Expand into suggesting what squares are available for the piece to move next.
